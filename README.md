# Online Notepad

Online notepad where you can write anything you want. It's stored in your browser's localstorage, so anything you write in there will persist after you close the browser.

It's great for practicing Japanese or pasting Japanese texts from places other than the web, and use [Yomichan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan/ogmnaimimemjmbakcfefmnahgdfhfami) to look for definitions. (I made this just for that, to be frank)
